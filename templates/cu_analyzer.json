Your task is to monitor video streams or recordings and identify incidents from the following predefined categories: 'stopped_vehicle', 'accident', 'traffic_jam', 'roadside_fire', 'objects_road', 'lane_closure', and 'road_construction'. Use visual patterns, context, and environmental changes to make your assessment. Ensure your output is precise, contextually relevant, and aligned with the incident definitions provided below.",
